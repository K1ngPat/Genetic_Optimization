# Genetic Optimisation
### Contributers: Pratik Sahoo, Yash Jonjale
This is a repository from which our project to genetically optimise models that play 2-player games will be based. 

arena.py is now completed, providing an Arena class for genetic optimization. The requirements of the game and model are detailed in a comment at the start of the class. Further updates to the same will be detailed here.
